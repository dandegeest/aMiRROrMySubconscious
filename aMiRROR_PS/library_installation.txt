# Required Libraries for aMiRROR Processing Sketch

You need to install the following library in Processing:

1. **Video Library**
   - Open Processing
   - Go to Sketch > Import Library > Add Library
   - Search for "Video"
   - Install "Video | GStreamer-based video library for Processing" by The Processing Foundation

### Java Version Requirement

The sketch now uses Java's built-in HTTP client which requires **Java 11 or newer**. Make sure your Processing installation is using a compatible Java version.

To check your Java version in Processing:
1. Open Processing
2. Go to Help > About Processing
3. It should show which Java version is being used

If you need to update Java, download the latest JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/).

After installing the Video library and ensuring you have Java 11+, restart Processing and open the aMiRROR.pde sketch.
